INSTRUCTIONS:


First you enter your script and check Server Side if it needs to run serverside 

Next you press the big button saying encrypt 

Then you run the pastebin URL (the one that gets generated) locally in SB (always run it client side, regardless of your script's type) 

Next you press each letter in the keyword in order to decrypt it 

Like you press each letter (or number) on your keyboard 

Then once you've done entering the characters you press enter to confirm 

(You don't enter the characters into a GUI or into the chat, you just press them on your keyboard) 

Also, press backspace to restart entering the characters 

And boom, script runs.
