Ok so first you enter your script and check ServerScript if it needs to run serverside(edited)
Then you press encrypt(edited)

Then you run the pastebin URL (the one that gets generated) locally in SB (always run it client side, regardless of your script's type)(edited)

Then you press each letter in the keyword in order to decrypt it
Like you press each letter (or number) on your keyboard(edited)
Then once you've done entering the characters you press enter to confirm
(You don't enter the characters into a GUI or into the chat, you just press them on your keyboard)
Also, press backspace to restart entering the characters

And boom, script runs
